<p>Hi and thanks for browsing. My name is Velizar.</p> <br></br>

          <span style={style}>What I do?</span>
          <br /> <br />
          <span>
            - I work in sales since 2015. It's one of my passions and a career
            path so far. I am quite good at it too.

            - Well, it's JS & React namely. I started out in order to be able to
            create application to aid me in my other interests, namely capital
            investing and financial markets.

          <br /> <br />
          <span>
            - I am an avid book reader. I enjoy autobiography books. The latest
            one is this of Benjamin Franklin.

        <p>- I am an amateur botanist.</p> <br />
        <p>
          - I am also a wannabe beekeeper (that's for some time in the future,
          when I am older).
        </p>{" "}
        <br />
        <p>
          - Lastly, I enjoy the occasional Techno festival. I've been to
          Amsterdam, Ibiza and others. My favourite DJs are Marco Carola, Paco
          Osuna, Hot Since 82 and more.

      <p>A few words about this project...</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The original reason I wanted to create it was to have a personal stock
        portfolio tracker for myself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the process of writing the code I came up with the idea to try and
        showcase as much of the things I have learned in programming so far in
        order for it to serve and aid me in applying for jobs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The code is written from scratch. I've used React and custom css. I was
        trying to showcase my usage of React hooks, Router, HTTP requests, etc.

        The market data is fetched from Alphavantage's API, whilst the contact
        form is making post requests to Firebase.

        I am especially proud with the way the intuitive search bar came to be.
        In the future I will continue adding features and functionalities here
        to serve my needs. Such include various graphs showing historic price
        movements, P/L tracker and hopefully much more.
