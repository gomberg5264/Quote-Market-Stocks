## About my Project

Hello and welcome. My name is Velizar and this is my simple stocks tracker. I follow the financial markets closely and wanted to create an app that allows me to monitor my favourite companies, read news related to them and follow how they perform.

\*\* The app is best viewed on laptop/PC as I've not made the design responsive yet

\*\* I have used custom design and self-written css from scratch.

\*\* I tried to showcase my usage of React, and tried to use all the things I learned in the course and/or knew before it.

\*\* The only thing I haven't made myself would be the market widget below the nav.

## What can you do with my Stocks Tracker

1. Without a registration, you could check the news feed, and search for individual stocks in order to see their current price and other relevant information.

2. A registered user has access to a portfolio, where he can add stocks to watchlist in order to monitor their performance more closely.

## What more is to be done

The app is far from finished. I have yet to implement extensive monitoring options for the chosed portfolio stocks, such as ROI, market history movements, graphs and other feature related to the data provided.

For the design itself - I want to make it responsive, which it currently isn't.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
